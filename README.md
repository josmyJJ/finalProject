# Harrison College

Harrison College is a small liberal-arts school in Harrison, Pennsylvania. In its 80 year history, Harrison has tried many new fads and trends, and in that same time period it has turned its back on just as many. Harrison has decided to get rid of its old system for tracking student enrollments and create its own.

Harrison has a standard system for recording and tracking its classes: each course has a course number and a subject code, name, description and number of credits. Each instructor has an employee number, name, department, and office number. Each student has a student number, name, major and year of entry. Harrison refers to the fact that they teach first semester English Composition as a course and the fact that this fall Dave Wolf is teaching freshman composition in Irech Hall at 8am on Mon and Wed as a class. Each class has a crn number, a course number & subject code, an instructor, and a classroom. Each classroom has a bldg name and a room number and a max capacity. Students canâ€™t enroll themselves in a class that has reached capacity.

- Each Instructor can teach anywhere from 0 to many classes.
- Each class can have anywhere from 0 to many students.
- Each course can have anywhere from 0 to many classes. (think instances)
- Each department can have 1 to many majors.
- You will need to allow for the 4 types of users: students, instructors, advisors and administrators.
